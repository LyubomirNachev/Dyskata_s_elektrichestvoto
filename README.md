Electric Skateboard
I use BLE for the communication between the ESP32 on the board configured as a host and the ESP32 on the remote configured as a server.

## Main Components:
* 2x ESP32 Dev kits
* 3x 12V9Ah Lead Acid Batteries
* 2x ZS-X11H v2 motor controllers
* 1x Wheel skateboard kit with 2 brushless motors
* 1x skateboard
* 100x Nerves :)

## Future features(I hope):
* Printed PCB 
* 3D model for the remote 
* 3D model for mounting and encapsulating the components on the board 
* Speedometer 
* Odometer 
* Charge indication 
* Interface for easier charging 
* GPS location for prevention from theft
